# Continuing Environments for Reinforcement Learning (`csuite`)


CSuite is a collection of synthetic reinforcement learning environments that are continuing â€” the agent-environment interaction goes on forever without limit, with no natural episode boundaries.
The continuing setting is a natural way to formulate the problem facing an RL agent with a long lifetime.

## Installation

Check out the source code into a local directory and install it from there:

```sh
git clone sso://team/deepmind-eng/csuite /path/to/local/csuite/
pip install /path/to/local/csuite/
```

`csuite` is not yet available from PyPI.
