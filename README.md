# Continuing Environments for Reinforcement Learning (`csuite`)


CSuite is a collection of synthetic reinforcement learning environments that are continuing â€” the agent-environment interaction goes on forever without limit, with no natural episode boundaries.
The continuing setting is a natural way to formulate the problem facing an RL agent with a long lifetime.
